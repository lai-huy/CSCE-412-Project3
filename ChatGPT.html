			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. It is a data structure that allows fast
				search, insertion, and deletion of elements. In a Red-Black Tree, each node has an extra bit that
				represents the color of the node. The nodes are colored either red or black.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="properties">
			<h2>Properties</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Every node is either red or black</li>
				<li>The root is always black</li>
				<li>Every leaf (NIL) is black</li>
				<li>If a node is red, then both its children are black</li>
				<li>For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black
					nodes</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="insert">
			<h2>Insertion into a Red-Black Tree</h2>
			<p>When inserting a new node into a Red-Black Tree, the following steps are followed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by inserting the new node as a leaf in the tree, just like in a regular binary search tree.
				</li>
				<li>Color the new node red.</li>
				<li>If the parent of the new node is black, the tree is still balanced and the process is complete.</li>
				<li>If the parent of the new node is red, then there are two cases to consider:</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section id="delete">
			<h2>Deletion from a Red-Black Tree</h2>
			<p>When deleting a node from a Red-Black Tree, the following steps are followed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, the node to be deleted is replaced with its in-order successor or predecessor.</li>
				<li>If the replaced node is black, the tree may become unbalanced and violate the Red-Black Tree
					properties.</li>
				<li>To restore balance, a series of rotations and color changes may be necessary, following a specific
					set of rules.</li>
			</ol>
